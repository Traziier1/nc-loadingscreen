# Forked Version of nc-loadingscreens

This is a forked version of the [nc-loadingscreens](https://github.com/NaorNC/nc-loadingscreens) created to add additional features for use in FiveM servers.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Volume Slider**
- Added a volume bar slider to adjust the volume of video/audio during the loading screen.

### 2. **Showcase Sections**
- Showcase sections have been added that allow you to:
  - Change the name displayed in the showcase
  - Set a custom image
  - Choose a display color for the showcase
  - Set a custom time duration for how long the showcase is visible before switching to the next

### 3. **Staff Member Quotes**
- Each staff member in the `config.js` now has a configurable quote that is displayed in the staff section. This gives more personality and recognition to staff members.

### 4. **Now Playing Feature**
- A "Now Playing" feature was added below the server description that dynamically displays the name of the currently playing song.

### 5. **Video Change Button**
- Added a button that allows users to change the video being played on the loading screen.

## How to Use
